# Platform for Training Cycle Management

## Project Overview

This project involves the **design and implementation** of a web-based platform aimed at streamlining the management of training cycles for the **Centre National de l'Informatique (CNI)**. The platform enables CNI employees and external participants to efficiently register and manage training cycles. The solution was developed as part of an internship project completed in **July 2024**.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Admin and users have distinct roles in the system. Admins can create, update, and manage training cycles, while users can register for them.
- **Training Cycle Management**: Admins can manage various aspects of training cycles, including participants, instructors, schedules, and locations.
- **Registration System**: A user-friendly registration process for participants interested in attending training sessions.
- **Report Generation**: The platform includes automated generation of attendance sheets and other essential reports for administrators.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP (v8.1), MySQL (XAMPP)
- **Modeling Tools**: UML for system design
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, and StarUML for diagrams.

## Architecture

The platform follows a **3-tier architecture**:
1. **Client Tier**: Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the frontend in browsers like Chrome or Firefox.
2. **Application Tier**: Built using PHP for handling business logic.
3. **Data Tier**: Manages and stores data in a MySQL database.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements include integrating **real-time audio/video conferencing features** to enhance the user experience and facilitate remote learning sessions.

## Conclusion

The platform successfully centralizes the training management process, improving efficiency and reducing errors in the administration of training cycles. This project has not only helped optimize resource management at CNI but also provided valuable hands-on experience in web development and system design.
